## Resistor

Resistance calculation of metal or semiconductor material is fundamental to IC engineering.
Consider a block of metal or semiconductor material with dimensions $L, W$ and $h$. Let $n$ be the charge per unit volume.
Let us calculate the current $I_R$ for an applied voltage $V_R$ across the length of the material.
